## Hi there 👋 I'm Freddy Cunningham

I'm a final-year Computer Science student at [Durham University](https://durham.ac.uk/), passionate about technology, Software Engineering, and continuous learning. Here's a bit more about me:

- 🔭 **Currently working on:** My dissertation titled "Energy Efficient Distributed Algorithms" and various projects involving algorithmic optimization and distributed systems.
- 🌱 **Learning:** Cryptography, Algorithmic Game Theory, Deep Learning and more as part of my final-year modules.
- 👨‍💻 **Experience:** I’ve led a team in a university-industry collaboration with IBM, developed real-time data analytics dashboards, and honed skills in full-stack development (Next.js, TimescaleDB).
- 🎯 **Projects:** Check out my latest work on the [Shortest Vector Problem Solver](https://github.com/freddyc2003/svp).
- 💬 **Ask me about:** Software engineering, distributed algorithms, and how to balance work and outdoor fun (I love the outdoors and have worked as a high ropes instructor!).
